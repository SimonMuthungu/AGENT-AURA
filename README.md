# **The Aura Engine**

THIS IS AN AUTONOMOUS LANGRAPH AGENT THAT provides **Autonomous Resource Allocation (AURA)** recommendations by consolidating critical project health data from disparate sources. It acts as the "FinOps Controller," giving Project Managers real-time, high-stakes budget and velocity insights.

### 🎯 Key Business Value

* **Solves:** The manual, error-prone process of calculating current project burn rate and resource allocation risk.
* **Output:** A single, actionable recommendation on whether a project is at risk and how to reallocate resources to mitigate that risk.
